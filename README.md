# covid-tracker-poc

This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept for an Android application that periodically grabs IDs (BT MACs and Wi-Fi SSIDs) from surrounding devices in such a way that, combined with a timestamp, can be used as coordinates for determining that two or more users may have been close together at some time.

The intention is to use this application to collect anonymous traceability data from citizens, so when someone tests positive from COVID-19, an alert can be sent to people that could have shared an space with that person.
